# Deepfake Detection System

This project presents a **custom DenseNet-121 architecture** for detecting deepfake images, benchmarked against **InceptionResNetV2** and **VGG16**. Our proposed DenseNet-121 model achieves superior performance with a **95.91% accuracy**, outperforming InceptionResNetV2 (**93.4%**) and VGG16 (**91.5%**).
